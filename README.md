# Binder repo for the Jupyter 'HelloWorld' widget

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PierreMarion23/jupyter-widget-hello-world-binder/master)

The notebook is adapted from the official Jupyter [doc](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Custom.html), and serves demonstration purposes.

It offers the possibility to test the widget using a [Binder](http://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) image (by clicking on the 'launch binder' button, and waiting a little).
